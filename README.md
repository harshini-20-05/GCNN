# GCNNs from Scratch

This project demonstrates a **from-scratch implementation of Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs)**, focused on achieving **rotation invariance** using cyclic groups (specifically the C4 group â€“ 90Â° rotational symmetries).

---

## ðŸ“Œ What We Did

- Implemented the core GCNN architecture **from scratch inside a Jupyter Notebook** (`gcnn-dl-assignment.ipynb`) without using any GCNN libraries.
- Used manually constructed rotation matrices to handle image transformations and weight sharing across rotated filters.
- Compared GCNN performance on:
  - Original upright MNIST digits.
  - The same digits rotated by 90Â°, 180Â°, and 270Â°.
- Verified that GCNNs maintain consistent accuracy across rotated inputs â€” highlighting **rotation equivariance**.

## ðŸ’¡ Model Design

To keep the implementation **lightweight and fast**, we intentionally used a **small number of layers** in our architecture. This helps reduce model complexity and training time, which is especially useful when:

- Testing new ideas quickly.
- Running on limited hardware.
- Focusing on verifying theoretical properties like group equivariance.

> ðŸ”¸ **Note:** We used a simple CNN as the base model for this GCNN implementation.  
> ðŸ”¸ For improved accuracy or more complex datasets, deeper or modern architectures can be adopted â€” see **Future Scope** below.

## ðŸ§ª Experiment Summary

- **Dataset Used:** MNIST (handwritten digits).
- **Model:** Custom-built GCNN using 90Â° rotation-aware filters.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Trained only on original (non-rotated) images.
  - Tested on rotated images to validate generalization.

### âœ… Observations:

- Standard CNNs struggle with rotated digits.
- Our GCNN achieved nearly **identical accuracy** on rotated and non-rotated test sets.
- Demonstrates that **GCNNs learn features invariant to input rotations**, making them ideal for symmetry-aware tasks.
